# afrimapr book

# Welcome

This is the in-progress book introducing map making in R using African data.

It is part of the [afrimapr](https://afrimapr.github.io/afrimapr.website/) project running in 2020-21.


The principle intended audience of the book are data analysts that need/want to make maps from data as a part of their routine work. We expect that readers will have had some limited experience of R and/or spatial data but this is not strictly required. We will take you step-by-step through code to obtain, manipulate and visualise spatial data. We focus on routine tasks and developing confidence and resilience in applying them, rather than starying to more advanced analyses. 


We welcome contributions, and will make avenues for contribution clearer soon.

In the meantime, do [get in touch](https://afrimapr.github.io/afrimapr.website/get-involved/).
