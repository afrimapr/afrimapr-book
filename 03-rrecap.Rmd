# R recap {#rrecap} 
This section provides a brief recap of the basic steps that are required or useful to do before staring on the project.

## Creating, naming and saving a new R script

The R script is a plain text file that allows you to save the R code containing both, command and comments. Saving the R script allows you to reuse your R code and creates a reproducible record of your work. Therefore, it is a good practice to create, name and save it at the very beginning of your project. 
You can crate a new R script by clicking the **New File** icon in the top right corner of the RStudio toolbar, which will open a list with different file options. Choose the **R Script** from the menu and the blank script will open in the main RStudio window.

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#fff5e6; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
**Shortcut**: New R script can also be opened by *Shift+Ctrl+N*
</div>



<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
**Hint**: To add comments next to your commands simply write a hashtag (#) beforehand. This will stop R from executing this specific part.
</div>
