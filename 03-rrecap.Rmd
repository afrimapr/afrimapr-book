# R recap {#rrecap} 
This section provides a brief recap of the basic steps that are required or useful to do before staring on the project.
## Creating, naming and saving a new R script
The R script is a plain text file that allows you to save the R code containing both, command and comments. Saving the R script allows you to reuse your R code and creates a reproducible record of your work. Therefore, it is a good practice to create, name and save it at the very beginning of your project. 

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
**Hint**: To add comments next to your commands simply write a hashtag (#) beforehand. This will stop R from executing this specific part.
</div>
