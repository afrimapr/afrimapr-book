# Contribution Guide

For internal & external contributors to the book. Please add anything to this document you find helpful.

See [template chapter](https://github.com/afrimapr/afrimapr-book/blob/main/16-template.Rmd) which sets out standard format for chapters

Internal contributors are encouraged to push text changes directly (you don't need to submit pull requests). To minimise potential for conflicts remember to pull before making changes and communicate with others about what you are working on.
