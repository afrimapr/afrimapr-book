# Template chapter {#template}

## Linking section 1
This initial section of each lesson (chapter) should build a link with the previous section of the book by providing a recap of what has been previously done. It will help with placing each chapter within the context of the entire book. 

## Overall goal of the chapter
In this section we will describe what is the overall aim of this chapter, including:

- Learning objectives: 
    - What will you learn?
    - What you will be able to do at the end of this chapter
    - What you will not learn & what to read instead
    - Where to go from here
    
- List of 'episodes' in this chapter that will help achieve set goal with their short description and an explanation of links between them

- Targeted audience
    - What they are expected to already know (their previous knowledge)
    - What are the goals of the audience

## Episode 1 (topic 1)
Each episode developed within the chapter should contain a narrative to give a bit of a context and again demonstrate the target audience. Beyond it should provide episode-specific learning objectives and examples, which are to be intertwined with so-called *self-check exercises* which will allow the reader to assess his comprehension of the topic so far. 

## Episode 2 (topic 2)

## Episode 3 (topic 3)

## Linking section 2
This closing section should show the reader what has been done in this chapter and how it links with the topics provided in the next chapter by a brief introduction to next topic.
