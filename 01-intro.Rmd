# Introduction {#intro}

[andy: we may move this text to the Preface later (coded in index.Rmd), but is more difficult to find there.]

## Why read this book

[mention reproducibility, html, markdown, QGIS etc.]

Read this book if you would like to be able to make maps from African data (or indeed other data too).


## Who for

The book is aimed principally at analysts who want to make maps from African data as a part of their routine work. We expect that readers will have had some limited experience of R and/or spatial data but this is not strictly required. We will take you step-by-step through code to obtain, manipulate and visualise spatial data. We focus on routine tasks and developing confidence and resilience in applying them, rather than moving to more advanced analyses.

## What this book will not cover

For those that are interested in spatial analyses we refer you to the excellent recent book [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/). The afrimapr book, in comparison, will cover fewer processes but do so in more detail and assuming less prior knowledge of R and spatial data. We see the two books as being complementary. Those that wish to take their work further after this afrimapr book should find the geocompr book useful. Those that have been through the geocompr book and would like more detail on visualising varied data sources in R should find this afrimapr book useful.
